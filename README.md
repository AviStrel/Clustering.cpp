# Clustering.cpp
Devide points in the euclidean plain into clusters with  Hierarchical clustering algorithm

The project was build in CLion 2018.2.5, at windows 7.

The assignment was taken from BIU(Bar Ilan university) course 89-570 Artificial Intelligence.
from the hebrew guideline check for HW3.pdf file.

The main is inside Simulator.cpp.
To run the project make sure that argv[1]=the name of input file(for example input.txt), argv[2]=the name of the output file(for example output.txt) and argv[3]=the path to the input and output files directory(for example /Users/User/CLionProjects/clusters/files/).

The headers are in "include" directory.

The sources are in "source" directory.

For input and the related output files, check "files" directory.
